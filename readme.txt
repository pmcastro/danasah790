DanaSah 7.9: corrected a bug in the SEE function and a small simplification of the evaluation. I do not expect much ELO, between 15 and 30.

Included Openings book, gaviota tablebases (3 men) and Scorpio bitbases (4 men)


Windows:
-------
danasah790_w32.exe --> DanaSah 32-bit (DanaSah is not bitboard)
danacfg.txt --> configuration file for xboard protocol

For Windows, you can set up a path for the openings book, Gaviota tablebases (5 men) and Scorpio bitbases (6 men). I recommend for games only use 5 men gaviota tablebases and use only 6 men scorpio bitbases for analysis.

Android:
-------
danasah790_arm7 --> DanaSah 32-bit for ARM7
danasah790_arm8 --> DanaSah 64-bit for ARM8

For Android, better use the uci protocol. You can set up a "full path" for the openings book and Gaviota tablebases (5 men)
